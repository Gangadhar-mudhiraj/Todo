# Taskify - Todo Application

This project is a task management application where users can create, update, delete, and manage their to-do tasks. It is built with React and integrates with Firebase for user authentication and Firestore for data storage.

## Features

- User Authentication (Sign up and Log in)
- Add, Edit, Delete Tasks
- Mark tasks as completed/incomplete
- Firebase Firestore as a real-time database
- Responsive design

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!**  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

## Firebase Setup

This app uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for storing tasks.  
Make sure to set up a Firebase project and add your Firebase config to the app.
